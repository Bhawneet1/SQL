# SQL Learning Resources

## Introduction
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them. This repository is designed to help you learn SQL from the ground up, covering basic to advanced topics.

## What is SQL?
SQL is a powerful language used for interacting with databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data efficiently.

## Basic SQL Commands
### SELECT
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

### INSERT
The INSERT statement is used to add new rows of data to a table.

### UPDATE
The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table.

### DELETE
The DELETE statement removes existing rows from a table.

## Data Types
Understanding different data types is crucial when designing a database.

## Filtering and Sorting Data
### WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.

### ORDER BY
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort results.

## Joining Tables
Understanding how to join tables is essential to retrieve related data.

### INNER JOIN
Returns records that have matching values in both tables.

### LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.

### RIGHT JOIN
Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.

### FULL JOIN
Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table records.

## Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

## Subqueries
Subqueries are queries nested inside another query.

## Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy.

## Indexes
Indexes are used to speed up the retrieval of data.

## Transactions
Transactions are used to manage changes made by DML statements.

## Advanced SQL
### Views
Views are virtual tables based on the result set of a query.

### Stored Procedures
Stored procedures are a set of SQL statements that can be stored and reused.

### Triggers
Triggers are special kinds of stored procedures that automatically execute in response to certain events on a particular table.

### Cursors
Cursors allow you to iterate over the rows of a result set.
